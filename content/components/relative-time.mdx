## Content

### Past dates

For past dates, the relative time outputs different formats depending on the time difference.

Within the current month, the output shows a relative date in the format of `X seconds/minutes/hours/days ago`. If the time difference is less than 1 minute, it shows `just now`.

After a month has passed, the output shows a relative date in the format `on D MMM` or `on D MMM, YYYY` depending on the current year.

### Future dates

As well as past dates, future dates output different formats depending on the time difference.

If the future date is due to happen within the current month, the relative time outputs the format of `in X seconds/minutes/hours/days`. If the time difference is less than 1 minute, it shows `just now`.

If the future date is due to happen within the following months, the relative time outputs the format of `on D MMM` or `on D MMM, YYYY` when following years.

### Micro format

The `micro` variant shows a smaller version of the relative time. It is useful for displaying the relative time in a more compact space or in a mobile environment. The output shows the relative time in the format of `Xs/h/d`, `D MMM` after a month, or `D MMM, YYYY` after a year.

## Usage

A relative time can be used within a sentence, following the action that it's relative to.

/>

### Isolated

A relative time can be used in isolation when the content and the surrounding elements make it clear what the time is relative to.

<Box display="grid" gridTemplateColumns={['1fr', null, null, null, '1fr 1fr']} gridGap={5}>
  <div>

    />

    />

When used in isolation, the default format can change to `micro` when the space is limited.

### Links

A relative time is used as plain text in most cases. However, it can be used as an anchor link to point to an element within a view that contains relevant or nested information.

## Accessibility

A relative time is treated like a [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) element when it shows a local numerical date, and it contains an [abbreviation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) element when it shows a relative date phrase.
