  A relative time displays the relative time difference between the source date-time and the provided date-time.
</Box>

## Content

### Past date-time

For past date-times the relative time outputs different formats depending on the time difference:

#### Less than 1 month

It shows relative date phrases in the format of `X days ago` or `X hours ago`:

#### After a month has passed

It shows the date in the format `MMM D` or `MMM D, YYYY` depending on the current year.

### Future date-time

It strictly shows relative date phrases in the format of `in X days` or `in X hours`. This will never switch to displaying the date, even after a month has passed.

## Usage

## Responsiveness

There are cases where relative dates needs to be placed in a spot that is too narrow to display a long relative date. In these cases, the output can be adapted to fit in the narrow area without sacrificing usability.

## Accessibility

A relative time is treated like a [time](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time) element when it shows a date, and it contains an [abbreviation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr) element when it shows a relative date phrase.
